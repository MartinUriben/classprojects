	<h2>What is Ajiaco?</h2>
	  <p>Ajiaco is a traditional Colombian soup, especially popular in Bogotá. It's rich, hearty, and made with a variety of ingredients.</p>
			
	
	<section> 
	<h2>Ingredients Required</h2>
	  <ul>
	
		  
		  
		<li>Chicken (bone-in, skinless pieces): About 4 chicken thighs or breasts.</li>

		<li>Papa sabanera (red potatoes): 4-5, thinly sliced.</li>
		<li>Papa pastusa (white potatoes): 4-5, thinly sliced.</li>
		<li>Corn on the cob: 2-3 ears, cut into thirds.</li>
		<li>Guascas (a key herb in Ajiaco): 2-3 tablespoons of dried guascas.</li>
		<li>Capers: For garnish, to taste.</li>
		<li>Heavy cream: ½ cup, for serving.</li>

	<h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
	
	<h3>Cook the Chicken</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>In a large pot, add the chicken thighs (or breasts) and pour in the chicken stock (or water) until they are fully submerged.</li>
		<li>Bring the stock to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
		<li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer the chicken for about 30 minutes or until cooked through and tender.</li>
		<li>Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside. Shred the chicken once it cools slightly, and reserve for later.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Add the Potatoes</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>To the same pot with the chicken stock, add the papa criolla, papa sabanera, and papa pastusa.</li>
		<li>Add the corn pieces to the pot as well.</li>
		<li>Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
		<li>Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let it cook for about 30-40 minutes. The papa criolla will break down and thicken the soup, while the other potatoes will remain chunkier.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Add the Guascas</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>When the potatoes have softened, add the guascas to the pot.</li>
		<li>Stir and let the soup simmer for another 10-15 minutes so the flavors can meld together.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Shred and Return the Chicken</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>While the soup continues to cook, shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces</li>
		<li>Add the shredded chicken back into the pot and mix well.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Final Adjustments</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Taste the soup and adjust seasoning as needed (more salt, pepper, or guascas).</li>
		<li>Let the soup simmer for another 5-10 minutes to blend flavors.</li>

		<li>When serving Ajiaco be sure to use hot bowls.</li> 
		<li>On the side you can provide bowls of capers, cream, and avocado slices so people can add them as desired.</li> 
		<li>White rice also makes for a delicious topping.</li> 
	</ol>
